          <p class="about-content">
            I was born in Poughkeepsie, NY, USA on August 27, 2012. I soon moved
            to Seoul, South Korea where I was raised for 4 years. In these four
            years, I developed a fluent speaking in Arabic (Egyptian Dialogue),
            which is my parents first language since they are both from Egypt. I
            also learned Korean due to my Korean community. Naviagting through
            the multicultural enviornment gave me an idea that there is more
            than one way and people in life, showing a variety.

          <p class="about-content">
            In 2017, I moved back to the United States, settling in Austin,
            Texas with my family due to my father's job change from
            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/" target="_blank">Samsung</a>. I
            started Pre-K 4 at Mills Elementary School, where I met many new
            people, different in language and culture. Throughout the next few
            years of elementary school, I learned English, which I am now fluent
            in and certified by the TELPAS test to have passed the aspects of
            English in reading, writing, listening, and speaking. It was a
            challenge at first, but I soon adapted to the new environment and
            made many friends along the way. I felt super supported by my
            teachers, which I am thankful for. I also I joined Kuk Sool Won of
            Oak Hill, teaching me displine, respect, and hard work. I have now
            achieved my first degree black belt, and I continue to train and
            learn more about the art. I also use these skills in my life,
            helping me stay focused and patient while programming and debugging,
            for example.

          <h2>Early Programming</h2>
          <p class="about-content">
            In 1st grade, my parents enrolled me in a programming class in an
            after school program, where I entered the cyber world of coding. I
            learned the basics and logic of programming through Scratch, a block
            programming UI. I continued to passionatly use this as a source of
            fun in my free time. Over time, I fell in love with the logic of
            programming and started creating more content on Scratch. My father
            works at Siemens, and he often works from home. I enjoy watching him
            code in
            <a
              href="https://www.tcl-lang.org/about/language.html"
              target="_blank"
              >Tcl</a
            >
            and running a program called
            <a
              href="https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/"
              target="_blank"

            >
            that provided a CAD type of software that you can use to design
            semiconductors and chips. I was fascinated by this, and I wanted to
            learn more about programming. I would watch my dad work while asking
            questions about what he was doing. He would explain the logic behind
            what he was doing and what he was trying to achieve in a suitable
            way for my age. This sparked my interest in learning more about
            programming.

          <h2>COVID-19</h2>
          <p class="about-content">
            In late 2rd grade in March of 2019, COVID-19 struck the world, and
            made impact everywhere. Schools were forced to shut down, and we had
            to adapt to a new way of learning through virtual classes. This was
            a challenge for me, as I had to adjust to a new way of learning and
            interacting with my teachers and peers online via Zoom. However, I
            soon adapted to this new environment and continued to learn and
            grow. Since we never had in-person classes, my parents decided for
            us to move to Cairo, Egypt next to my grandparents as a temporary
            living just so we can get closer as a family. I had to have all my
            classes between the hours of 4pm to 12am due to the time difference,
            but I made it work. During this time, my mother found me in great
            boredom and sadness since I missed my friends and school. She found
            a programming series on YouTube by a young women named Neha teaching
            Python as a teenager on a channel called. I changed my main
            languages from Scratch to Python because I felt confident with the
            overall logic, and I was ready for advancded "typing coding."
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz-Ivq2jVGbWMavr0YZYgJQ"
              target="_blank"
              >NPStation</a
            >. At the time, the channel was super small with less than 700
            subscribers. Now it currently 21K subscribers and is a huge
            community built by a person that had a dream at my age. This
            motivated me to always be persistent and never give up. I started
            learning Python thorugh her videos, becoming fluent in these
            language. I created small projects, such as a calculator. I
            continued to learn Python using a library called
            <a
              href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html"
              target="_blank"
              >Tkinter</a
            >
            (also known as Tk), built on Tcl. I used
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXPyB4XeYLA"
              target="_blank"
              >this video</a
            >, made by Codemy.com, to learn Tkinter usage. I built UI
            applications passionatly. This was a huge jump for me. I was
            learning a text-based programming language, and I was loving every
            bit of it. I even savored every bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
            becoming my main languages to program in.

            opportunities.I also took advanced classes in math and science,
            which helped me develop my problem-solving skills and critical

          <h2>My Leap</h2>
          <p class="about-content">
            I started 7th grade with some curiosity on how to make a website
            online in a professional way. I talked with my dad a bit on it, but
            I was still confused on one part. How does a domain get registered
            with a specific person. That's when I stumbled across a new friend
            named Humayd Khan. He taught me and helped me setup a server using
            <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/" target="_blank"
              >Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5 LTS</a
            >. I also bought my first domain called
            <a href="https://zarcotech.dev" target="_blank">zarcotech.xyz</a>
            (now deprecated, so it won't load. This will redirect to the new
            main page). I learned how to use DNS configurations on
            <a href="https://cloudflare.com" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a>, and
            using a reverse proxy tool called
            <a href="https://nginx.org/" target="_blank">Nginx</a> (pronounced
            "Engine-X") to get my online local websites onto my domain. This was
            a huge leap for me. I was hosting my own websites online, and I
            was loving every bit of it. I continued to learn more about web
            development, cybersecurity, and server management. I even started
            learning about ethical hacking and penetration testing in 8th grade,
            which fascinated me.

          <p class="about-content">
            In early January of 2025 while writing an essay for school, I
            decided to search for any Arabic Hip-hop artists to cover my boredom
            and plainness while writing. I first stumbled across Wegz, who is a
            very popular Egyptian artist that has major hits such as "Dorak Gai"
            and "El Bakht" at the time. I started a

            of my favorite songs of his on Spotify. As I continued to search, I
            found many other artists such as Marwan Moussa, Afroto, and Marwan
            Pablo. These 4 artists are what I call the "Big 4", as they are many
            other artists I enjoy, such as Mond, Abyusif, and Hala, but these

          I also realized I have been driven to where I am today by many people,
          including my family, friends, teachers, and mentors. I am thankful for
          everyone has given me everything to even the smallest push to the
          success I have currently. I am excited for the future, and I am ready
          to take on the next of challenges and change.
